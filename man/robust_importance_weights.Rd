\usage{
robust_importance_weights(
  resid,
  robust_method = c("none", "huber"),
  robust_estimator = c("M", "S"),
  previous_importance_weight = NULL,
  huber_tuning_k = 1.345
)
}
\arguments{
\item{resid}{a vector that may contains outliers.
May be weights (inverse of pseudo-variance) or residuals(?!)}

\item{robust_method}{If \code{method = "none"}, then all subjects are
included in the coefficient estimation.
If \code{method = "huber"}, huber weights are
assigned to each subject based on the \dQuote{pseudo-residuals} \code{rr}.}

\item{robust_estimator}{If \code{robust_estimator = "M"},
M-estimation is performed. If \code{robust_estimator = "S"},
S-estimation is performed. This argument specifies the tuning method,
i.e., the method for defining outliers in each iteration, when applying
Huber or Bisquare reweighting method (\code{robust_method = "huber"} or
\code{robust_method = "bisquare"}).}

\item{previous_importance_weight}{importance weights in the previous iteration,
used to calculate the importance weights in the current iteration for the
S-estimation. If \code{previous_importance_weight} is NULL, it indicates the
first iteration, and thus S-estimation need to be initialized.}

\item{huber_tuning_k}{The tuning parameter of the Huber's M-estimator.}
}
\value{
{importance_weight} An vector of length n, the importance weights.
If a subject is to be removed from the current iteration,
its importance weights is 0.
}
\description{
Outliers or some unexpected resid due to extremely small/large
weights may occur in both observations and intermediate
procedures. Hence, robust estimations are be considered to "down-weigh"
the abnormal observations.
