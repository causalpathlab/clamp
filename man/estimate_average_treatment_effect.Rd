\title{Estimate the average treatment effect (ATE) via inverse probability weighting (IPW)}
\usage{
estimate_average_treatment_effect_binary(
  X,
  y,
  W,
  mle_estimator = c("mHT", "WLS"),
  standardize = NULL,
  centralize = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{An (n by p) data matrix; each entry would be 0 or 1.}

\item{y}{An (n by 1) vector of responses.}

\item{W}{An (n by p) weight matrix.}

\item{mle_estimator}{Estimation approach. \code{"mHT"} stands for the
modified Horvitz-Thompson estimator. \code{"WLS"} stands for the weighted
least-squares estimator.}
}
\description{
This function provides two approaches to provides IPW estimates of the ATE.
One IPW estimator is the modified Horvitz-Thompson (mHT) estimator, and
the alternative is the weighted least-squares (WLS) estimator. When the input
\code{\mathbf{X}} is binary, the IPW estimates from these two methods should
be equal.
